# AI-Powered-Video-Audio-Correction-System
This project lets users upload a video, transcribe and correct its audio using GPT-4, and replace the original audio with an AI-generated voice. Built with Streamlit, it integrates Google Cloud's Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech for transcription and voice synthesis, ensuring the new audio is synced with the video.
